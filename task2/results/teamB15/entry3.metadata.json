Entity is selected among the retrieved entities, belonging to the predicted domain. For knowledge extraction, we extract key phrases from the knowledge titles and treat them as relations. The final task of extraction is treated as a relation linking problem, where we link the user utterance to a relation extracted from the provided knowledge. The system combines classification and knowledge extraction approaches with adding noise to all  training data: random fillers and random word splitting. Each sentence in training set is \u201cattacked\u201d.\n"
