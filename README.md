# DSTC10 Track 2 - Knowledge-grounded Task-oriented Dialogue Modeling on Spoken Conversations

This repository contains the data, scripts and baseline codes for [DSTC10](https://dstc10.dstc.community/) Track 2.

This challenge track aims to benchmark the robustness of the conversational models against the gaps between written and spoken conversations.
Specifically, it includes two target tasks: 1) [multi-domain dialogue state tracking](task1/README.md) and 2) [task-oriented conversational modeling with unstructured knowledge access](task2/README.md).
For both tasks, participants will develop models using any existing public data and submit the model outputs on the unlabeled test data set with the ASR outputs.

**Organizers:** 
Seokhwan Kim, Yang Liu, Di Jin, Alexandros Papangelis, Behnam Hedayatnia, Karthik Gopalakrishnan, Dilek Hakkani-Tur

## Rules
* Participation is welcome from any team (academic, corporate, non profit, government).
* Each team can participate in either or both sub-tracks by submitting up to 5 entries for each track.
* The identity of participants will NOT be published or made public. In written results, teams will be identified as team IDs (e.g. team1, team2, etc). The organizers will verbally indicate the identities of all teams at the workshop chosen for communicating results.
* Participants may identify their own team label (e.g. team5), in publications or presentations, if they desire, but may not identify the identities of other teams.
* Participants are allowed to use any external datasets, resources or pre-trained models which are publicly available.
