# DSTC10 Track 2 - Knowledge-grounded Task-oriented Dialogue Modeling on Spoken Conversations

This repository contains the data, scripts and baseline codes for [DSTC10](https://dstc10.dstc.community/) Track 2.

This challenge track aims to benchmark the robustness of the conversational models against the gaps between written and spoken conversations.
Specifically, it includes two target tasks: 1) [multi-domain dialogue state tracking](task1/README.md) and 2) [task-oriented conversational modeling with unstructured knowledge access](task2/README.md).
For both tasks, participants will develop models using any existing public data and submit the model outputs on the unlabeled test data set with the ASR outputs.

**Organizers:** 
Seokhwan Kim, Yang Liu, Di Jin, Alexandros Papangelis, Behnam Hedayatnia, Karthik Gopalakrishnan, Dilek Hakkani-Tur
